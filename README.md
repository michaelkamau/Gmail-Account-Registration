# Gmail Account Registration

####**DISCLAIMER: There is nothing here related in any way to Gmail, Google or anything owned by Google. If you want to register for a Gmail account please head over to the [Google sign up page](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp)**

Anyway, I am just experimenting with HTML and CSS here. This is an attempt to clone the look and feel of the gmail
registration page.
Note that I have used Twitter Bootstrap for styling.

## Why am I doing this?

These labs are part of the Andela boot-camp set of programming assignments, which am currently participating in.

Feel free to comment on the code or ask any questions about the boot-camp.
